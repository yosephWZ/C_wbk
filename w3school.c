17. The natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 7 are 3, 7, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 25.



18. In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, . . .



20. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as taco cat or madam or racecar or the number 10801. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.



21. 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

26. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3) that are both smaller than 6.



27. In the 20×20 grid below, four numbers along a diagonal line have been marked in red.
